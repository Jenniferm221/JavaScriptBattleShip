# Battleship
To further practice my coding skills I wanted to make a few different kinds of projects other then the React work I did with Bloc. This Battleship project is a simple execution of HTMLS, CSS and JavaScript. While it does have that dated MSDOS feel, it was a good exercise in programming logic. As you "Fire!" at your opponent It will tell you if you successfully "hit" or "missed". This was alot of fun to make! It has full functionality and is mobile responsive.
